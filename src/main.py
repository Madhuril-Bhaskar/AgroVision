    ## üåø Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System

    > *"Healthy plants, healthy planet."*

    Our platform is built to empower farmers, botanists, agricultural researchers, and plant enthusiasts with the tools to **instantly identify plant diseases using advanced AI models**.

    ---

    ### üß≠ What is This System?

    This system is a **deep learning-powered web application** that detects plant diseases from leaf images. It uses a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** model trained on thousands of healthy and diseased leaf images across multiple plant species.

    Whether you're an agriculturist looking to monitor crops or a student working on a research project, this tool is designed to give you fast, accurate, and actionable insights.

    ---

    ### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

    1. **üì§ Upload Image**  
    Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload a clear image of a plant leaf.
    
    2. **üî¨ Image Analysis**  
    Our AI model processes the image and compares it against trained plant disease classes.
    
    3. **üìà Output Result**  
    You'll instantly receive a diagnosis with the **predicted disease name** and confidence level.

    ---

    ### üåü Features & Benefits

    - **‚úÖ High Accuracy**  
    Built using TensorFlow, trained on 87,000+ images across 38 classes.

    - **üñº Real-Time Predictions**  
    Upload an image and get results in less than a second.

    - **üì± Fully Responsive UI**  
    Powered by Streamlit, works smoothly on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

    - **üåê Accessible**  
    Easy-to-use interface for farmers with no technical background.

    - **üìä Scalable Design**  
    Can be expanded to include treatment recommendations and multi-language support.

    ---

    
    ### üöÄ Getting Started

    1. Click the **"Disease Recognition"** tab from the sidebar.
    2. Upload a high-quality image of a leaf.
    3. Click **Predict** and let our system do the rest!
    4. Get your result and take action immediately.

                 #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
                #### Content
                1. train (70295 images)
                2. test (33 images)
                3. validation (17572 images)

                
    
                ### üìå Supported Crops & Diseases

                Our model currently supports crops like **Apple, Corn, Grape, Peach, Potato, Tomato, Strawberry, and more**, with diseases including:

                - Apple Scab  
                - Tomato Mosaic Virus  
                - Potato Late Blight  
                - Grape Black Rot  
                - and **30+ more**
